Auditing
The use of a shared account by multiple people limits the ability to monitor or audit who has used the account at any given time. Shared accounts may also offer partial or full anonymity to those that use them. This can be problematic for tracking who accessed a system or made system changes, and who viewed or modified data. The use of shared accounts by individuals to access sensitive information may also violate contractual or regulatory requirements. For example, in general, shared accounts should not be used by individuals to access Protected Health Information (PHI). Exceptions must comply with UW Medicine Information Security Standards including but not limited to SS-01, SS-03, and SS-07.

Password Management
Adequately managing the password for a shared account can be difficult because the password must be shared with multiple people. Care must be used to distribute the password in a secure manner, and the password must immediately be changed when someone who used the account no longer needs access. The more people that know a password, the more likely the password could become compromised.
